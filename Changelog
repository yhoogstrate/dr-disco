2016-11-13	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.1.0
	* Rewritten rejoin_splice_junctions resulting in a huge performance
	  increase. Uses HTSeq for genomic indexing, also resulting in a
	  huge performance increate. Rewritten and improved
	  extract_subnetworks_by_splice_junctions. Added test cases that
	  earlier failed in the development phase because of complex race
	  conditions. Using enum datatypes for Edge-types to improve memory
	  consumption. Added __lt__ function to quickly compare based on
	  genomic positions as hashes. Indexing and sorting is now also
	  based on this. Use xranges of ranges to improve performance.

2016-11-02	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.9
	* Fixes critical race condition in extracting subnetworks with Edges that
	  are also splice junctions.

2016-11-01	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.8
	* Output includes columns containing the number of splice junctions

2016-10-31	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.7
	* Fixed a few small flaws in pruning (taking an alignment mistake
	  offset of 3bp into account and pruning nodes an identical l-position

2016-10-28	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.6
	* Better order in final output file

2016-10-27	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.5
	* Uses a single index structure for accessing all edges in a sorted
	  manner in order to improve the speed of pruning

2016-10-26	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.4
	* Total distance in pruning (sum of two sides) may not be more than
	  the insert size

2016-10-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.3
	* Improved extract_subnetworks to extracting only by splice junctions
	  Traversing is now limited on the insert size

2016-07-25	Youri Hoogstrate
	* Improved pruning system in many ways and fixed special behaviour for
	  spanning_singleton_1/2 by adding spanning_singleton_1/2_r because
	  half of those were in the opposite strand. The HI-tag was used to
	  correct for this.

2016-06-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.2
	* fix-chimeric makes a destinction between spanning_paired_1 and spanning_paired_2
	  depending on wether it was the first or second chunk of the broken/split read.
	  This is also implemented for spanning_singleton_1/2.

2016-06-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.1
	* First working prototype with setup tools for fix-chimeric
