2017-07-05	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.8.1
	* Looser settings and new shape for entropy filter

2017-06-22	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.8.0
	* Adds `dr-disco integrate` to find genomic breaks and exon-to-
	  exon fused splice junctions that belong to the same event
	* Adds donor acceptor calculation
	* Adds possibility to add gene names by adding a GTF file

2017-06-16	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.7.1
	* Allows running `dr-disco fix` in parallel mode (random tmp files)
	* Classified on slope
	* Many new entries in blacklists

2017-05-17	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.7.0
	* Changed CLI interface
	* Added `dr-disco classify`
	* Removed classification step from `dr-disco detect` such that
	  classification can be done without re-running detect completely.
	* Added blacklist system plus a few known contaminants
	* Fixed broken nose (dependency)
	* Adds some extra variables useful for classification
	* Improved the TP and FP ratio of the filter

2017-04-12	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.6.0
	* Changed behavior of pruning: less post-merging steps necessary
	* Added two extra variables that can be used for classification

2017-04-05	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.5.0
	* Large improvements in parsing junctions from reads and much better
	  performance on circRNAs

2017-03-23	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.4.0
	* Adds column indicating whether a result is likely to be circRNA
	* Adds column with genomic distance between breakpoints

2017-03-13	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.5
	* Using shutil.move over os.rename (http://bugs.python.org/issue14848)

2017-03-02	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.4
	* Better way of handling stdio / logging for bioconda compatibility

2017-02-08	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.3
	* Huge improvement in performance in `extract subnetworks` by translating
	  a recursion problem into an iterative linear problem.

2017-02-03	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.2
	* Allows to run `dr-disco bam-extract` on non 'fixed' BAM-files
	  plus corresponding test cases

2017-02-01	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.1
	* Fix in bam fixing code for reads annotated with identical SA-tags

2017-01-30	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.3.0
	* Changes in CLI interface

2016-12-22	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.2.0
	* Rewritten large parts of the code
	  Improved classification system
	  Added argument (-m) allowing a trade-off between sensitivity and time

2016-11-13	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.1.0
	* Rewritten rejoin_splice_junctions resulting in a huge performance
	  increase. Rewritten and improved
	  extract_subnetworks_by_splice_junctions. Added test cases that
	  earlier failed in the development phase because of complex race
	  conditions. Using enum datatypes for Edge-types to improve memory
	  consumption. Added __lt__ function to quickly compare based on
	  genomic positions as hashes. Indexing and sorting is now also
	  based on this. Use xranges of ranges to improve performance.

2016-11-08	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.10
	* Uses HTSeq library as genomic index which improves performance.
	  Other speed improvements.

2016-11-02	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.9
	* Fixes critical race condition in extracting subnetworks with Edges that
	  are also splice junctions.

2016-11-01	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.8
	* Output includes columns containing the number of splice junctions

2016-10-31	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.7
	* Fixed a few small flaws in pruning (taking an alignment mistake
	  offset of 3bp into account and pruning nodes an identical l-position

2016-10-28	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.6
	* Better order in final output file

2016-10-27	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.5
	* Uses a single index structure for accessing all edges in a sorted
	  manner in order to improve the speed of pruning

2016-10-26	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.4
	* Total distance in pruning (sum of two sides) may not be more than
	  the insert size

2016-10-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.3
	* Improved extract_subnetworks to extracting only by splice junctions
	  Traversing is now limited on the insert size

2016-07-25	Youri Hoogstrate
	* Improved pruning system in many ways and fixed special behaviour for
	  spanning_singleton_1/2 by adding spanning_singleton_1/2_r because
	  half of those were in the opposite strand. The HI-tag was used to
	  correct for this.

2016-06-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.2
	* fix-chimeric makes a destinction between spanning_paired_1 and spanning_paired_2
	  depending on wether it was the first or second chunk of the broken/split read.
	  This is also implemented for spanning_singleton_1/2.

2016-06-15	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.0.1
	* First working prototype with setup tools for fix-chimeric
