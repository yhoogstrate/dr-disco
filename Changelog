2018-04-03	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.16.3
	 * Fixes `SA:Z:` tags by swapping strand information with CIGAR and
	   by replacing chromosomes to `=` if they are the same. This will
	   solve prevent dissapearing pannels in IGV 2.4.1 - 2.4.10.
	   A backwards incompatibility fix has directly been implemented and
	   the changes do not affect the outcome and only improve
	   visualization.

2018-02-01	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.16.0
	 * Adds the exons before the break and exons after the break to the

	   [-2,+2] because STAR may introduce slight offset errors.
	 * Fixes bug in integrate where rather similar fusions in opposite
	   strands were still bundled together.

2018-02-01	Youri Hoogstrate	v0.15.2
	 * Makes mismatches per base classification more stringent
